# customer-segmentation-clustering
Description
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a dataset containing customer demographics and spending information. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to guide marketing strategies and business decisions.

Key Features & Steps

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked for missing values and duplicates.

Encoded categorical variables (Gender â†’ 0/1).

Selected features: Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions (histograms, boxplots) and relationships (scatter plots, pairplots).

Detected outliers and analyzed correlations between variables.

Data Standardization

Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler for clustering.

Optimal K Selection

Tested k values from 2 to 10.

Used Elbow method, Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Score.

Chose k = 5 as the optimal number of clusters.

K-Means Clustering & Profiling

Trained final K-Means model with k=5.

Added cluster labels to the dataset.

Profiled clusters to analyze average characteristics per segment.

Visualizations & Insights

Scatter plots: Annual Income vs Spending Score, Age vs Spending Score.

Pairplots and boxplots to explore clusters.

Identified five distinct customer segments with unique demographics and spending patterns.

Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
